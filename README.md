# Popular Movies App
This is the second and third project of the Android Developer Nanodegree Program on Udacity.

The second part simply extends the first one, adding the functionality of adding / removing favorites. Also, displaying videos and reviews, as well as implement share intent.

The first part uses simple buttons - look like on-off switch - to navigate from popular to top rated movies. While the second part uses navigation drawer menu.
