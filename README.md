# Popular Movies App

## Refactored

This used to be a 2-part project developed during my enrollment on Android Developer Nanodegree Program on Udacity.
After few years and more experience gained, I decided to refactor - actually re-write - it, in order to bring it up-to-date with all current guidelines and technologies used on modern android development.
This aims to be a sample for people trying out things on android and at the same time it will work as a playground for me to explore areas I haven't the chance before.

## Initial versions

This is the second and third project of the Android Developer Nanodegree Program on Udacity.

The second part simply extends the first one, adding the functionality of adding / removing favorites. Also, displaying videos and reviews, as well as implement share intent.

The first part uses simple buttons - look like on-off switch - to navigate from popular to top rated movies. While the second part uses navigation drawer menu.
